# BlackJack
First Capstone Project

While I was learning Python, I have created this wonderful game by using basic concepts of Python such as loops, functions, conditions etc.
I believe, I made some solid foundation of Python by making this game and this foundation is gonna help me in future to build more interesting and complex projects.

This Project folder contains 3 files:
  (i) art.py  : which contains ASCII ast of black jack logo
  (ii) main.py : Which contains the complete code of program step by step
  (iii)Flowchart.pdf : which is helpful to understand logic of the game
